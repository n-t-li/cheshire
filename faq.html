					<div class="block_faq_title">What is Reach and Wash?</div>
					<div class="block_faq_content">
						None of us like change, but in this case you will be very impressed by the aded benfits you will gain from this new technology.<br><br>
						Below we have explained a little bit about the process, so that you can understand the new way we could clean your windows.
					</div>

					<div class="block_faq_title">How it works?</div>
					<div class="block_faq_content">
						Whilst we are moving away from the dangers of working at height, along with the inconvenience and intrusion this often causes, we are simultaneously changing to a more environmentally-friendly and efficient method called "Pure Water Cleaning"<br><br>
						No chemicals of detergents - Just the absolute simplicity of purified water<br><br>
						We will be using purified water to clean your windows and will be using special brushes mounted onto telescopic poles to reach the high windows.<br><br>
						The pole will be connected via a tube to the water storage tank which has a pump that is powerful enough to reach windows over 80 foot high.
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="block_faq">
					<div class="block_faq_title">Why Pure Water?</div>
					<div class="block_faq_content">
						Although tap water looks clean, it actually contains a lot of disolved chemical and minerals. These amounts vary from area to area (hard & soft water areas). It is these minerals (mainly calcium and magnesium) that leave a white residue on glass.<br><br>
						The water purification technology (the machine which cleans the water) de-mineralises and de-ionises tap water to remove these impurities and produce pure water.
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="block_faq">
					<div class="block_faq_title">Can I work in the rain with a pure water system?</div>
					<div class="block_faq_content">
						If we examine the water cycle, we learn that the water evaporates from the surface of lakes, rivers and the sea. Their mineral content is left behind when the water vaporises, which means that when the water condenses and forms clouds, the water is pure.<br><br>
						It is this pure water that falls as rain. The rain does not stay pure for long however, because as it falls through the atmosphere, the water molecules bind to and dissolve all the minerals it comes into contact with on its way to the ground.<br><br>
						While this water is no longer pure, it does have a relatively low mineral content. In the UK with our usual south westerly winds, the total dissolved solids reading of this water is around 14 TDS, with the limit for spot free drying being 9 TDS or lower. (Some tap supplies will reach 500+ TDS)<br><br>
						When cleaning windows with pure water, pure water is left to dry naturally on the glazing, when the rain comes into contact with this water, it serves to dilute the rain water. If an equal amount of rain water falls on the freshly washed glazing, the TDS reading of that water will then read 7 TDS within the range of spot free cleaning.<br><br>
						In short then, you can clean windows with pure water in all but the most torrential rain with most satisfactory results.<br><br>
						Many clients may well be sceptical at first, as using chemical cleaners leave a residue that becomes sticky and actually attracts dirt and that is what they will be used to. However once they have seen the results for themselves, most clients will have no problem with you calling when the weather is far from ideal.<br><br>
						<strong>Pure water is the best product to clean windows for several reasons:</strong><br><br>
						— By virtue of the nature of water, it does not like being pure and it strives to return to its impure state. Therefore it actually absorbs dirt particles from the glass, aiding the cleaning process.<br>
						— Because of the aggressive strength of pure water, youdo not need to use cleaning detergents on the windows. Thus you save money and time, plus it's better for the environment.<br>
						— Due to the impurities being removed, you do not need to squeegee the windows, simply rinsing the glass after brushing leaves an excellent streak free finish.

					<div class="block_faq_title">More Questions Answered</div>
					<div class="block_faq_content">
						<b>Question</b>
						I am very pleased with the end result but you previously left my windows and sills dry, now when you leave they are wet?<br><br>
						<b>Answer</b>
						Please do not be concerned by this, it is only pure water which is even less harmful to your building than rainwater. Because this water dries without leaving streaks, it is unnecessary to squeegee the windows dry. This water will quickly evaporate without a trace in a few minutes.<br><br><br>
						<b>Question</b>
						I have tried cleaning my own windows with cheap telescopic poles and it dries white, how will you do a better job?<br><br>
						<b>Answer</b>
						Normal tap water contains minerals, including, calcium and magnesium. It is these which leave a white residue on the glass. What we use is Pure water, filtered by a de-ionising and de-mineralisation process. This dries to a crystal clear shine. We bring this water with us in large van-mounted tanks.<br><br><br>
						<b>Question</b>
						Will I see the difference straight away?<br><br>
						<b>Answer</b>
						Whilst you will, ultimately, see enormous benefits with Pure Water Cleaning, this may not be immediately apparent. For instance, traditional “chammy and ladder” cleaning avoids the window surround and frames. However, we now clean everything, which obviously brings accumulated debris down onto the glass. Also it takes a few washes to remove the residue of years of detergent. This means that the first few cleans with Pure Water may not give the full effect. It might be about the 2nd or 3rd clean that you start to really notice the difference. After that it will be a breeze and you will never want to go back.<br><br><br>
						<b>Question</b>
						It looks so complicated compared to a bucket and squeegee, I am just not convinced it can do the job as good as traditional window cleaning.<br><br>
						<b>Answer</b>
						It actually does a better job, in most cases we clean the window frames as well with our brush so that is an added bonus to you. The process is faster, safer, superior to traditional window cleaning as we are using fresh, clean water on each window, not water from a bucket. Please do not be daunted by all the equipment at the end of the day it is just a pole with a brush on the end that pumps the pure water onto your window, it is actually a very simple process that has been made affordable. We can demonstrate the process on just one of your windows to reassure you if that helps ease your mind.<br><br><br>
						<b>Question</b>
						I am worried the high water pressure will damage my windows?<br><br>
						<b>Answer</b>
						It’s not the water pressure or the pressure of the brush on the window that does the cleaning, it is the gentle agitation of the brush bristles and the pure water on the dirt that does the cleaning. Very little pressure is needed.
